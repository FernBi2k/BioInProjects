2.In your own words, please summarize the function of each of the commands (e.g., abyss-pe, k, B, etc) that you included in your code.

The codes I used for the abyss output were:
	- conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge abyss
	- abyss-pe name=unknown k=96 B=2G in='RBSB_S187_R1.fastq  RBSB_S187_R2.fastq'
- The first line of code was to install Abyss so that I would be able to use it in Ubuntu. 
- The second line of code assembles paired reads (abyss-pe) from the 2 files for my unknown genome titled "RBSB_S187_R1.fastq" and "RBSB_S187_R2.fastq". They are assembled into contigs named "unknown". The "k=96" refers to the k-mer size being used for the assembly algorithm. An appropriate k-mer size impacts the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm during assembly. In this case, a k-mer size of 96 bases was used. The "B=2g" refers to the allocation of memory used by the device to run the algorithm. "B=2G" means 2 gigabytes of memory was used for the assembly process. 

3.Using either output, perform a BLAST search to identify your species. Write your species name here:

The species name is Bacillus sp. KBS0812

4. Perform quality assessment using QUAST. You need find a reference genome and reference annotation to upload to QUAST for the best quality check. Which assembler gave you the higher quality output? How do you know?

Assembly gave me the higher quality output. Comparing the abyss output and the spades output against the reference genome using QUAST, abyss had only a misassembly rate of 1 and its contigs were only 6 off. Other factors include N50 length and assembly size. 

5) Describe what BUSCO is used for. What were the BUSCO values for your assembly?

BUSCO is used for assessing the completeness of a genome. Using the abyss output assembly, the values for my BUSCO were "Status Complete" 

7)In your own words, what is the function of each of the commands in your line of code?

- For Prokka i used the codes 
	- mamba activate genomeassembly - this activates the environment 
	- conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c defaults prokka - this installs the actual program prokka that will be used 

8) What is the function of the genes/features you chose?
	- recA - plays a crucial role in DNA repair
	- 16S rRNA - forms the functional ribosome, which is essential for protein synthesis
	- gyrA - an essential component of bacterial DNA replication and transcription

9) RAST is job is pending at the time of submission
